# My Frontend Mentor Challenges

This is where I will put my in progress, and completed, [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/challenges) challenges.

# Challenge Difficulty

Each [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/challenges) challenge is catergorized by difficulty level:

- [Newbie](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?difficulties=1)
- [Junior](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?difficulties=2)
- [Intermediate](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?difficulties=3)
- [Advanced](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?difficulties=4)
- [Guru](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?difficulties=5)

I will seperate each challenge by difficulty based on this scaling.
